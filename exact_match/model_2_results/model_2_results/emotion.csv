1,it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere .
2,the movie fails to portray its literally talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
3,the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis .
4,"I don't think I laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem ."
5,"it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp !"
6,It does exactly what is says.  Can't get any better than that!  Nice to be able to watch movies on the big screen as opposed to my little Nook screen!
7,This product has been working well still and I would definitely purchase from them again.
8,"These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning."
9,"Would love to give it 5 stars, but the ONE and only thing missing from this is that the charging indicator light doesn't work."
10,Looks better on line than the actual camera photo album - Still nice!
